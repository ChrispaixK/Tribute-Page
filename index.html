                <p class="item-description">Lake Tanganyika is an African Great Lake. It is the second-oldest freshwater
                    lake in the world, the second-largest by volume, and the second-deepest, in all cases after Lake
                    Baikal
                    in Siberia. It is the world's longest freshwater lake.This lake has many beaches on its shores
                    stretching
                    from the capital city Bujumbura all the way to Nyanza Lac in southern Burundi.
                    You can also see hippopotamuses come out of the water and rest on the beaches with people.

                    traditional huts with extraordinary histories.

                <p class="item-description">When one travels 12km (7.45 miles) south of Bujumbura, the capital, they’ll
                    find the Livingston and Stanley stone, a memorial to commemorate the journey of the two British

                <p class="item-description">Another important place to visit in Burundi is the southern source of the
                    Nile, which is located in Rutovu district, in southern Burundi and around 120km (74.5 miles) from
                    Bujumbura. A pyramid has been built there and attracts many visitors. It is located in a place with
                    lower temperatures and it is amazing to watch how the long Nile flows from a well-built pyramid and
                    makes its way towards the Mediterranean Sea.

                    lies atop the mountains of the Congo-Nile Divide. It extends north from the provincial town of

                <h4 class="item-title">Kagera Falls</h4>
                <p class="item-description">The Kagera Falls are a spectacular series of waterfalls. They are located to
                    the south of Rutana. The falls occupy over 142 hectares, being made up of six branches divided on
                    three landings. On a first level, is a main fall subdivided into two parallel branches of a length
                    estimated at 80 m about which pours on a basin. This fall consists of several waterfalls of
                    different sizes intersected with two platforms. Another smaller waterfall is located roughly 50 m to
                    the west of this main fall. Waters of these two falls converge on a second landing to form the third
                    waterfall which pours on the valley.

                <h4 class="item-title">The Rusizi River </h4>
                <p class="item-description">The Ruzizi is a river, 117 kilometres long, that flows from Lake Kivu to
                    Lake Tanganyika in Central Africa, descending from about 1,500 metres to about 770 metres above sea
                    level over its length. The steepest gradients occur over the first 40 kilometres, where
                    hydroelectric dams have been built. Further downstream, the Ruzizi Plain, the floor of the Western
                    Rift Valley, has only gentle hills, and the river flows into Lake Tanganyika through a delta, with
                    one or two small channels splitting off from the main channel. The Ruzizi is a young river, formed
                    about 10,000 years ago when volcanism associated with continental rifting created the Virunga
                    Mountains.

                <h4 class="item-title">Tea & Coffee</h4>
                <p class="item-description">Burundi is home to many coffee and tea farmers. Most people know the coffee
                    that comes in Nestlé cans or the bags of tea. But before the final stage, coffee and tea crops are
                    what Burundi mountain dwellers work with several times before their harvest. Having and managing a
                    coffee plantation has become the culture in some places. Come and visit the farmers in their homes
                    and see their crops and how coffee and tea are treated before they are exported.

                <h4 class="item-title">Hospitality</h4>
                <p class="item-description">Burundi’s citizens are known to be highly hospitable . A visitor, or
                    “Umushitsi”, in Kirundi, is respected and protected. It is customary for a local to attempt to speak
                    the visitor’s language and offer help rather than expecting the foreigner to attempt to speak the
                    local language. This love towards visitors is an historical heritage, as even before the
                    colonization by Germany and Belgium, hospitality was one of the foundational stones of Burundian
                    society.
